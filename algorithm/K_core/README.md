# Bioinformatics: K-Core subgraph for PPI
Finding the Highest K-Core Subgraph in a Protein-Protein Interaction  Network

A k-core in a graph is a subgraph in which all the nodes in that subgraph have at least degree k. In other words each node in a k-core has at least k immediate neighbors. 

In this example, the interaction network is given as a set of undirected edges that comprise a graph. There will be no self-edges in this graph. 

The programs outputs the value of k of the highest k-core in the network and the gene/proteins names of the nodes in the highest k-core.
